#
# Every time I get back to writing in bash, I end up writing a (new)
# library that does awful things with traps.
#
# Usage:
#  function foo() {
#  	eval "$(ltraps)"
#
#  	ltrap "echo foo"
#  	ltrap "echo bar"
#  	ltrap "rm -rf /"
#  	luntrap
#  }
#
#  eval "$(globaltraps)"
#  ltrap "echo foo"
#  ltrap "echo bar"
#  ltrap "rm -rf /"
#  luntrap
#
# NOTE: if `set -e` is used, globaltraps must be active for _any_ traps
#       to run on error. Otherwise the shell will exit without running
#       any traps because errors are not converted into returns.
#       If globaltraps is active, it will run all currently active scopes
#       before exiting.
#
# Unfortunately, EXIT traps do not have access to the local scope anymore
# (which seems to be a bug in the first place, however convenient it was),
# so we cannot "unwind" organically by accessing $__traps and unsetting
# it repeatedly until it does not exist anymore.
#
# Instead, do things the ugly way: maintain two stacks simultaneously and
# chop off the top of the global stack on RETURN.
#

# WTF moment
# ---
# If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will remain so
# (appearing as unset) until it is reset in that scope or until the function
# returns. <...> If the unset acts on a variable at a previous scope, any
# instance of a variable with that name that had been shadowed will become
# visible <...>.
# ---
# We don't use this anymore, however, preserve this function for posterity:
# this function creates an artificial scope such that any unset that is
# performed on behalf of the caller always acts on "a previous scope".
# (See commit message for details)
